An important part of winning at Monopoly is choosing the best loactions to buy. This involves buying those with the highest footfall.

This project used a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the probablility of a player landing on a space. Buying these should icrease revenue compared to buying at random.

The project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/underwhelmed-ape/monopoly_simulator) and the results found in a Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/underwhelmed-ape/monopoly_simulator/blob/master/monopoly_square_visit_counts.ipynb)
